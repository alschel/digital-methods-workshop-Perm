### 1.1. Spatial data

Distance - direction - spatial relations - geogrphical position - geographical context

*Classroom case*

### 1.2. Spatial data types

Spatial phenomena can generally be thought of as either discrete locations (spatial objects) or as continuous phenomena, for example, elevation, temperature, population density, etc.

**Spatial data**:  
* raster data (*continuous phenomena*)  
* vector data (*spatial objects*)

In R the main libraries for working with spatial data are `sp` and `raster`.

#### 1.2.1 Raster data

A raster divides the area into a grid of equally sized rectangles (*cells* or pixels). The size of one cell is called the *resolution* of the raster.
All the cells have values (or a missing value) for the variables of interest. Cell value normally represents the average (or majority) value for the area it covers. Cell value refers to an *intensity* of the process.

**ASTER GDEM 2011** elevation data

```{r elevation 1, echo=TRUE}

library(sp)
library(raster)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(lattice)
library(latticeExtra)
library(rasterVis)

# Read raster data
elev <- raster("data/ASTGTM2_N58E056_dem.tif")
elev
```

The natural *coordinate reference system* for geographic data is *longitude/latitude*. In this case x.y show the location of the given point on “spheroid”. However, if we want to make map, we have to transform this three dimensional system to a two dimensional planar system. This transformation is called *projection*. So, by projection you flatten your original spheroid into the plain surface with some mathematical calculations.

```{r elevation 2, echo=TRUE}
# Plot 
levelplot(elev, margin=FALSE, colorkey=list(space='bottom',
                                            labels=list(at=seq(0,350, 50), font=4),
                                            axis.line=list(col='black'),
                                            width=0.75),    
          par.settings=list(strip.border=list(col='transparent'),
                            strip.background=list(col='transparent'),
                            axis.line=list(col='transparent')),
          xlab = NULL,
          ylab = NULL,
          scales=list(draw=FALSE),
          col.regions=colorRampPalette(rev(brewer.pal(8, 'RdYlGn'))[1:7]), 
          alpha.regions = 0.7,
          at=seq(0,350, 50),
          names.attr="bbb")

```

Let's take a look at the same area on OpenStreetMap.

```{r leaflet, echo=TRUE, out.width="100%"}
library(leaflet)
# Load leaflet map
leaflet() %>% setView(lng = 56.33, lat = 58.3, zoom = 9) %>% addTiles()

```

#### 1.2.2 Vector data

The main vector data types are points, lines and polygons. In all cases, the geometry of these data structures consists of sets of coordinate pairs (x, y). **Points** are the simplest case. Each point has one coordinate pair.  
**Lines** are represented as ordered sets of coordinates (nodes). The actual line segments can be computed by connecting the points.  
A **polygon** refers to a set of closed polylines. The geometry is very similar to that of lines, but to close a polygon the last coordinate pair coincides with the first pair.

```{r vector data, echo=TRUE}
# Let’s make some objects of Spatial* class from scratch
longitude <- c(-116.7, -120.4, -116.7, -113.5, -115.5, -120.8, -119.5, -113.7, -113.7, -110.7)
latitude <- c(45.3, 42.6, 38.9, 42.1, 35.7, 38.9, 36.2, 39, 41.6, 36.9)
lonlat <- cbind(longitude, latitude)
pts <- SpatialPoints(lonlat)

# Set the coordinate reference system
crdref <- CRS('+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84')
pts <- SpatialPoints(coords = lonlat, proj4string = crdref)

# To create SpatialLines and SpatialPlygons we can use spLines() and spPlolygons() from raster package
lon <- c(-116.8, -114.2, -112.9, -111.9, -114.2, -115.4, -117.7)
lat <- c(41.3, 42.9, 42.4, 39.8, 37.6, 38.3, 37.6)
lonlat <- cbind(lon, lat)
lns <- spLines(lonlat, crs=crdref)
pols <- spPolygons(lonlat, crs=crdref)

# Create maps
plot(pols, border = "blue", col = "yellow", axes = T) # plot polygon
points(pts, pch = 20, col = "red", cex = 2)           # plot points
```

**Spatial object** = **geometry** + **attributes**

### 1.3. The case

Perm, 1910

Perm was founded in 1723 during the rule of Tsar Peter the Great. In XIX century the city became a major trade and industrial center. Today the population of the city exceeds 1 million.  
  
We will study the urban growth of Perm *by studying the age of the city buildings*. This approach is called **urban morphology**.
  
`Urban morphology refers to "the study of the physical (or built) fabric of urban form, and the people and processes shaping it"` (<http://www.urbanform.org/glossary.html>)

Building Age Map can help us to define a historical core of the city, main directions of the growth, old and new districts. We will study form and spatial structure of the city, revealing history of its formation.
